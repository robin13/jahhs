What is SQLite
SQLite is an Open Source, ACID-compliant embedded relational database management system.


Advantages of SQLite
- Zero-Configuration
- Serverless (so no database server process)
- Single Database File
- Stable Cross-Platform Database File
- The most used database in the world (Firefox, Thunderbird, iOS, 
- Weakly typed (like Perl! :) )


Disadvantages of SQLite
- Serverless
- Zero-Configuration
- Not scalable (serverless, single file...)
- Missing/incomplete features:
  - Triggers (only partial support)
  - Views (read only)

Interfaces:
- Commandline: sqlite3
- Perl: DBD::SQLite



What is ACID?
Atomicity
  Each transaction is said to be atomic.
  If one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails
Consistency
  The consistency property ensures that any transaction the database
  performs will take it from one consistent state to another.
  e.g. only integers allowed in integer fields
  e.g. propper rollback functionality
Isolation
  Isolation refers to the requirement that other operations cannot access
  data that has been modified during a transaction that has not yet completed.
  row locking, table locking
Durability
  Durability is the ability of the DBMS to recover the committed
  transaction updates against any kind of system failure (hardware
  or software).
  Transaction log / Journal
